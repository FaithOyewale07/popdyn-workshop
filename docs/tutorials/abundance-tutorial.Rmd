# Live demo #1: Capture-recapture for closed populations 

<style type="text/css">pre {font-size: 18px}</style>

---
# Example with a single group

## Load package

```{r}
library(RMark)
```

---
## Read and prepare the data

```{r}
mouse <- convert.inp("dat/mouse.inp",
                    group.df = NULL,
                    covariates = NULL)
```

Inspect first lines of the dataset 
```{r}
head(mouse)
dim(mouse)[1] # number of individuals captured at least once
```

---
## Fit a first batch of models

To use RMark, we need three steps : 
- Prepare the data
- Define the models to fit
- Fit the models

---
## Prepare the data

```{r}
mouse.proc <- process.data(mouse, 
                           begin.time = 1, 
                           model = "FullHet")
mouse.ddl <- make.design.data(mouse.proc)
```

`model = FullHet` refers to the most complex model form, allowing simpler models to be fitted as specific cases

---
## Define models (1)

Use a function that do three things:
- Specify the effects in the model to be fitted
- Create a list of all models to be fitted
- Prepare them for Mark

Note that RMark considers capture probability $p$ and recapture probability $c$ to be different

To fit a model vith $p$ and $c$ equal, use  `share = TRUE`  

---
## Define models (2)
```{r}
run.mouse <- function() {
# List of effects 
p.dot <- list(formula =  ~ 1, share = TRUE) # M0 : p constant over time
p.dot.behav <- list(formula =  ~ 1) # Mb : p and c differ
p.time <- list(formula =  ~ time, share = TRUE) # Mt : p varies over time
p.h <- list(formula = ~ mixture, share = TRUE) # Mh : p is heterogeneous between individuals (Pledger's mixture model)
p.time.behav <- list(formula =  ~ time) # Mtb
p.h.behav <- list(formula =  ~ mixture) # Mbh
p.h.time <- list(formula = ~ time + mixture, share = TRUE) # Mth
p.h.time.behav <- list(formula =  ~ mixture + time) # Mtbh

## Build model list
mouse.model.list <- create.model.list("FullHet")

## Prepare list to send to Mark
mouse.results <- mark.wrapper(mouse.model.list,data = mouse.proc,ddl = mouse.ddl)

## Grab results
  return(mouse.results)
}
```

---
# Fit models

Fit at once all models prepared with the function above 
```{r}
mouse.results <- run.mouse()
```

---
# Inspect outputs

```{r eval = FALSE}
mouse.results
```

Look at column `model` to get details of effects included

---
# Inspect outputs

```{r}
mouse.results
```

---
# How do we identify models?

The models appear in the same order as we specify them in the building model function:
```{r}
names(mouse.results)
```

---
# Get estimates of a specific model

We called $M_0$  "p.dot" in the building model function

This is the name used in the object storing the results
```{r}
mouse.results$p.dot$results$real
```

+ `pi` is not relevant here as the model does not include heterogeneity

+ `p` is the capture and recapture probability

+ `f0` is the estimated number of missed individuals (never captured)

---
# How to get abundance estimates?

Abundance $N$ is a derived parameter estimated using 'f0' and the number of caught individuals

To get its estimate: 
```{r}
mouse.results$p.dot$results$derived
```

---
# Model with two groups

## Read and convert the data

Read the file, do not forget to grab the information on sex of individuals
```{r}
mouse <- convert.inp("dat/mouse_groups.inp",
                    group.df = data.frame(sex = c("M","F")),
                    covariates = NULL)
```
---
# Look at the data
```{r}
head(mouse)
```

---
# Prepare the data

Same steps as before but specify that we have some groups, here 'sex'
```{r}
mouse.proc <- process.data(mouse, 
                           begin.time = 1, 
                           model = "FullHet",
                           groups = "sex")
mouse.ddl <- make.design.data(mouse.proc)
```

---
## Define models to be fitted
```{r}
run.mouse <- function() {
  p.dot <- list(formula =  ~ 1, share = TRUE)
  p.dot.behav <- list(formula =  ~ 1)
  p.time <- list(formula =  ~ time, share = TRUE)
  p.h <- list(formula = ~ mixture, share = TRUE)
  p.time.behav <- list(formula =  ~ time)
  p.h.behav <- list(formula =  ~ mixture)
  p.h.time <- list(formula = ~ time + mixture, share = TRUE)
  p.h.time.behav <- list(formula =  ~ mixture + time)
  # Mbsex - model with sex on capture probability AND recapture probability
  p.sex.behav <- list(p = list(formula = ~ sex),c = list(formula = ~ sex))
  ## Build model list
  mouse.model.list <- create.model.list("FullHet")
  ## Prepare list to send to Mark
  mouse.results <- mark.wrapper(mouse.model.list,
                              data = mouse.proc, 
                              ddl = mouse.ddl)
  ## Grab results
  return(mouse.results)

```

---
# Get estimates

```{r}
mouse.results$p.sex.behav$results$real
```

+ `pi` not relevant as no heterogeneity was fitted

+ `p gF` capture probability of females /  `p gM` capture probability of males 

+ `c gF` recapture probability of females / `c gM` recapture probability of males

+ `f0 gF` number of females never caugth / `f0 gM` number of males never caugth
