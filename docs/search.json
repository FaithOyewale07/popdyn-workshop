      "contents": "\nWhat: Quantifying population dynamics is crucial for the conservation and management of animal and plant species. This workshop deals with the analysis and modelling of population dynamics. In this introductory workshop, we will cover population projection matrix models, the estimation of demographic parameters (e.g. survival, dispersal) using capture-recapture models and the estimation of population density and abundance using capture-recapture, N-mixture and distance sampling models. Our hope is to provide you with what you need to go your own path. The event is free of charge, and video-recorded.\nFor whom: This is a workshop for ecologists. Basic knowledge of R is required.\nHow: The format of the workshop will be a combination of lectures and live demonstrations in R with packages popbio, RMark and unmarked.\nWho: Olivier Gimenez, Aurélien Besnard and Sarah Cubaynes.\nWhen: March 21-22, 2022\nWhere: Online\nProgram\nPopulation projection matrix models\nIntroduction to matrix models\nAge- and stage-structured models\nLeslie models as a particular case; sensitivity analysis.\nIntroduction to popbio\nFurther analysis issues: density-dependence; random environment; demographic stochasticity / branching processes; multisite and multistage models\nEstimation of survival, transition between reproductive states, productivity using capture-recapture and generalized linear models\nSurvival estimation from capture-recapture data\nMultiple group, age and cohort models\nIncorporation of external covariates\nIntroduction to RMark\nFurther analysis issues: estimation of recruitment and population growth rate by reversing capture histories; multi-state models allowing estimation of transitions (including movements)\nEstimating abundance and density of populations\nIntroduction to counting methods\nConventional methods and the detectability issue\nCapture-recapture, N-mixture and line transect samplings\nIntroduction to unmarked\nFurther analysis issues: introducing covariates; heterogeneity\nRequirements\nInstall R and RStudio.\nInstall the R packages unmarked and popbio.\nInstall the R package Rmark following the steps described at http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/rmark/.\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.
