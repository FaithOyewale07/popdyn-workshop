      "contents": "\nWhat: Quantifying population dynamics is crucial for the conservation and management of animal and plant species. This workshop deals with the analysis and modelling of population dynamics. In this introductory workshop, we will cover population projection matrix models, the estimation of demographic parameters (e.g. survival, dispersal) using capture-recapture models and the estimation of population density and abundance using capture-recapture, N-mixture and distance sampling models. Our hope is to provide you with what you need to go your own path. The event is free of charge, and video-recorded.\nFor whom: This is a workshop for ecologists. Basic knowledge of R is required. See R for beginners by E. Paradis for an introduction.\nHow: The format of the workshop will be a combination of lectures and live demonstrations in R with packages popbio, Distance, RMark, AICcmodavg and unmarked.\nWho:\nLecturers: Olivier Gimenez, Aurélien Besnard and Sarah Cubaynes.\nHelpers: Coline Cannone, Thierry Chambert, Thibaut Couturier, Valentin Lauret\nWhen: March 21-22, 2022  Mornings 9am-12am and afternoons 2pm-5pm (Paris time UTC+2 GMT+1)\nWhere: On YouTube\nDay 1: https://youtu.be/iqlqc5a4r7w\nDay 2: https://youtu.be/b08d1BBqf5E\nProgram\nEstimating abundance and density of populations\nConventional methods and the detectability issue\nCapture-recapture, distance sampling and N-mixture\nEstimation of demographic parameters using capture-recapture models\nSurvival estimation from capture-recapture data\nUsing covariates to explain variation\nInference about dispersal\nPopulation projection models\nCount-based projection models\nAge- and stage-structured models\nSensitivity analyses\nRequirements\nInstall R and RStudio. RStudio is recommended but not mandatory.\nInstall the R package RMark following the steps described at http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/rmark/. For Mac users, the installation is a bit tricky, check out the procedure here.\nInstall the R packages unmarked, Distance, AICcmodavg and popbio directly from the console with\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"unmarked\", \"popbio\", \"Distance\", \"AICcmodavg\"))\n\n\n\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.
