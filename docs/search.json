      "contents": "\nWhat: Quantifying population dynamics is crucial for\nthe conservation and management of animal and plant species. This\nworkshop deals with the analysis and modelling of population dynamics.\nIn this introductory workshop, we will cover population projection\nmatrix models, the estimation of demographic parameters (e.g. survival,\ndispersal) using capture-recapture models and the estimation of\npopulation density and abundance using capture-recapture, N-mixture and\ndistance sampling models. Our hope is to provide you with what you need\nto go your own path. The event is free of charge, and\nvideo-recorded.\nFor whom: This is a workshop for ecologists. Basic\nknowledge of R is required. See R\nfor beginners by E. Paradis for an introduction.\nHow: The format of the workshop will be a\ncombination of lectures and live demonstrations in R with packages\npopbio, Distance, RMark,\nAICcmodavg and unmarked.\nWho:\nLecturers: Olivier Gimenez,\nAurélien Besnard and Sarah Cubaynes.\nHelpers: Coline Cannone, Thierry Chambert, Thibaut Couturier, Valentin Lauret\nWhen: March 21-22, 2022  Mornings 9am-12am and\nafternoons 2pm-5pm (Paris time UTC+2 GMT+1)\nWhere: On YouTube\nVideo recordings available at: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5CiXbb9zgjSS_nJUiLKsIFKOSPINS3P6\nProgram\nEstimating abundance and density of\npopulations\nConventional methods and the detectability issue\nCapture-recapture, distance sampling and N-mixture\nEstimation of demographic parameters using capture-recapture\nmodels\nSurvival estimation from capture-recapture data\nUsing covariates to explain variation\nInference about dispersal\nPopulation projection models\nCount-based projection models\nAge- and stage-structured models\nSensitivity analyses\nRequirements\nInstall R\nand RStudio.\nRStudio is recommended but not mandatory.\nInstall the R package RMark following the steps\ndescribed at http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/rmark/. For Mac\nusers, the installation is a bit tricky, check out the procedure here.\nInstall the R packages unmarked,\nDistance, AICcmodavg and popbio\ndirectly from the console with\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"unmarked\", \"popbio\", \"Distance\", \"AICcmodavg\"))\n\n\n\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.
